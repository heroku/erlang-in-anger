# README

This book intends to be a little guide about how to be the Erlang medic in a
time of war. It is first and foremost a collection of tips and tricks to help
understand where failures come from, and a dictionary of different code
snippets and practices that helped developers debug production systems that
were built in Erlang.

This is the source repository for the book.

## Build

I Have TeXShop from MacTeX and I just press the 'Typeset' button when editing
`text.tex`

## Roadmap

- Update libraries links where appropriate
- Support alternative formats (HTML, epub, mobi)
- Document standalone build instructions that do not rely on MacTeX / TexShop

## Changelog

### 1.3.0

- Updated chapters 1 and 2 to refer to rebar3 instead of rebar, and to include
  content relative to hex and packages
